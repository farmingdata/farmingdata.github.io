Great, so do we! At **Farming Data**, we’re building an inclusive market access tool for impoverished farmers across the world. And we need your help and expertise to do it!

### About our startup  

**Farming Data** develops user-centric software and uses an inclusive approach to enable farmers in rural areas to connect to markets better. With a vision of reaching the SDGs by 2030, our aims are to help reduce post-harvest waste, shorten the reach to local and regional buyers, and double the incomes of small-scale farmers.  

We are passionate about empowering small-scale farmers across the world to embrace the digital
revolution, by developing tools that are inclusive of their needs. Internally, we encourage an
environment of being **evidence-based**, being **user-focused**, driving **healthy growth**, and **learning from our mistakes**!

* Build front-end Android applications, back-end development, and data analytics
* Work with other developers and designers to create the best user experience (UI/UX)

Bachelor’s degree, equivalent training, or work experience)
* Have a good understanding of data structures (e.g. NoSQL), algorithms, and programming languages (e.g. python, java)  
* Be familiar with the Android tool ecosystem (or be able to pick it up quickly!)
