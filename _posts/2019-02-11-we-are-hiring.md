With a vision of reaching the SDGs by 2030, our aims are to help reduce post-harvest waste, shorten the reach to local and regional buyers, and double the incomes of small-scale farmers.  

We are passionate about empowering small-scale farmers across the world to embrace the digital
revolution, by developing tools that are inclusive of their needs. Internally, we encourage an
environment of being **evidence-based**, being **user-focused**, driving **healthy growth**, and **learning from our mistakes**!
