### What do our behind-the-scenes look like?  

We've been inspired by many examples of how to make the UI/UX (user interface / user experience) as intuitive as possible for end-users. At the same time, a lot of the backend coding is seemingly done in a black box. So, I thought I'd share with you some of the behind-the-scenes during our time at our startup incubator ([Allia Serious Impact](https://seriousimpact.co.uk/)).

Previously, we started off with some draft drawings of the necessary workflow of a functioning platform. In other words, what would the user need to see for them to post their crops, check current prices, search for and buy available crops? Our team went through multiple brainstorming discussions about the key features that would be absolutely necessary for the platform's functionality and what could be considered as future add-ons.  

We went through multiple rounds of pen-and-paper drawings and designing screen-to-screen flowcharts, keeping in mind [Material Design](https://material.io/). We then proceeded to detail the app's layout as wireframes and then experimented with different colours to see how the interface might look like.

### And what about choosing the type of operating system for our platform?

This was an easy question to answer right off the bat. Android has the largest global market share ([88% as of 2016](https://qz.com/826672/android-goog-just-hit-a-record-88-market-share-of-all-smartphones/)) and has larger presence in low- and lower-middle income countries, as opposed to iOS. Moreover, the price of Android-based smartphones has been decreasing over the years.  

Another aspect we had to consider was ensuring we develop for suitable Android versions in order to serve our future customers. If one takes a look at the [distribution of Android versions](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html), you can see that accommodating from KitKat and beyond (e.g., Lollipop, Marshmallow, Nougat, and Oreo) will cover a large enough percentage.
